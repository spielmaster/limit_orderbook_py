# limit_orderbook_py
Python implementation of a limit orderbook data structure.

Why?
This project is not intended for any practical use case.
The aim is 
- to provide reader with a snapshot of my Python knowledge
- provide a snapshot of my knowledge in data-structures, algorithms, design patterns
- better understand the mechanics of an orderbook before implementing it in C/C++ (in which case a practical application could be considered for futher more interesting projects)
